        Tesla FSD, or Full Self-Driving Capability, is a package of advanced driver-assistance features (ADAS) developed by Tesla that aims to provide autonomous driving functionality to Tesla vehicles. It's important to note that FSD is currently in beta testing, meaning it's still under development and not yet a finished product.

Here's a breakdown of Tesla FSD:

What it does:

Autosteer on highways: Helps keep the car centered in its lane on highways, even on curves.
Navigate on Autopilot: Plans and executes a route from one place to another, including highway interchanges and exits.
Autopark: Parks the car automatically in parallel or perpendicular parking spaces.
Summon: Brings the car to you from a parking space.
Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control: Identifies stop signs and traffic lights and automatically slows the car to a stop on approach. This feature is currently in limited release.
What it doesn't do:

Drive itself without any driver supervision.
